Implement everything as libraries so standalone applications can be written
for testing (this was also my intention from the beginning since the
compiler must somehow be part of the slaves).

The logical order of things would then be:
 1. complete the P language (with standalone compiler),
 2. complete the DBMS (library),
 3. complete the PROTOCOL and then master, slave and clients.
